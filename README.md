# Formula 1 2025 Season – Top Three Finishers Analysis

# Project Overview
This project presents a structured race-by-race analysis of the **top three finishers (P1–P3)** from the **2025 Formula 1 season**, compiled directly from the official **Formula1.com Results** section.
The dataset captures **driver performance, constructor dominance, power unit distribution, official race times, and finishing gaps**, enabling clear performance comparisons across races.
This project focuses on **data accuracy, standardization, and analytical presentation**, simulating how raw sporting data can be transformed into decision-ready insights.

## 📊 Data Scope
For each race, the dataset includes:

- Race-wise **P1, P2, and P3 finishers**
- Driver & Constructor details
- Power Unit (Engine Manufacturer)
- Official race time (Winner)
- Gap to winner for P2 and P3
- Standardized formatting for cross-race analysis

**Data Source:**  
All data has been manually collected and verified from the **Formula1.com → Results** section to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Structured tabular modeling
  - Conditional formatting for visual clarity
  - Filters and standardized schemas
- **Manual data validation & reconciliation**
- **Domain-driven data modeling (Motorsport analytics)**

## 📈 Key Analytical Objectives
- Identify **driver and constructor dominance trends**
- Compare **power unit performance across races**
- Analyze **time gaps and race competitiveness**
- Enable future extensions into dashboards or predictive models

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Importance of **data standardization** when working with manually sourced datasets
- Structuring raw sports data into **analysis-ready formats**
- Applying **visual encoding** to improve interpretability
- Translating domain knowledge into meaningful analytical datasets
